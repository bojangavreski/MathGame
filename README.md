# MathGame

## Introduction
This is a simple real-time math game made using .NET 8 and Angular.
To answer the need for real time communication we are using Microsoft's SignalR.
Keep in mind that this is only a demo for educational purposes and there is a room for a lot of improvements.

### Getting started 

### Server
To start the game first of all you need to clone this repository.
``` git clone ```
When you successfuly cloned the repo. You may want to start the API first.

Primarily we want to publish the database. For the database it is mandatory to have SQL Server 2022 installed.
When the publish is done, run the API project.

### Angular
To run the UI, we need to have Angular 17 installed, hence this requires NodeJS version of at least 18.13. 

To start the UI, run the following commands: 

Open angularClient in VS Code or in your preffered Text editor and run the following commands:
``` cd math-game ```
``` ng serve ```

## Enjoy
